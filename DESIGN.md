# OSINT Engine — Design Specification

> Reference document for all contributors and coding agents (Codex, Claude, Gemini, Copilot).
> This file defines the **what and why**. Build briefs (e.g. `PHASE1_BRIEF.md`) define the **how and now**.
> When in doubt, this document wins. If you need to deviate, update this document in the same change.

## 1. Purpose & scope

A modular **OSINT collection engine** for cyber-focused investigations (infrastructure, exposure, identity), built for real professional use. It takes a seed (domain, IP, email, etc.), fans out across pluggable **connectors**, normalizes everything into a typed **entity graph** with full provenance, and produces a reproducible, auditable investigation result.

A later phase adds an **agent layer** that orchestrates the engine's connectors for pivoting and report-writing. The agent never produces intelligence on its own — it only calls connectors and synthesizes their grounded output.

**Primary domain:** cyber (infrastructure & exposure). General-purpose entities (person, org) are first-class in the schema but secondary in connector coverage.

---

## 2. Non-negotiable principles

These are architectural invariants, not guidelines. Every connector and every result must honor them.

1. **Passive by default, active only with authorization.** See §7. This is a hard gate enforced by the orchestrator, not a convention.
2. **Every data point carries provenance.** No entity or relationship exists without at least one source record (which connector, which source, when, and a reference to the raw artifact).
3. **Every data point carries a confidence score** (0.0–1.0). Corroboration across independent sources raises it.
4. **Reproducibility & audit.** Every run logs every query made, in order, with timestamps. Re-running the same seed against the same sources yields the same entity IDs (deterministic identity).
5. **Connectors are isolated and declarative.** A connector declares what it accepts, what it produces, and whether it is passive or active. Adding a source = dropping in one module. No connector reaches into engine internals.
6. **The engine never silently violates rate limits or ToS.** Rate limiting and polite backoff are mandatory and centrally enforced.

---

## 3. Architecture layers

Phase 4 generalizes the orchestrator into a frontier-based multi-hop loop. It still dispatches applicable connectors concurrently per seed, but newly discovered entities are only enqueued for later hops when they pass the pivot policy and the run's depth/budget limits.

## 4. Entity model

Entities are the nodes of the graph. Every entity shares a common envelope; type-specific fields live in `attributes`.

### Common envelope (all entities)

| Field         | Type                  | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `id`          | `str`                 | Deterministic. Derived from `(type, canonical_value)`. See §6. |
| `type`        | `EntityType`          | Enum. |
| `value`       | `str`                 | Canonical, normalized value (lowercased domain, compressed IPv6, etc.). |
| `attributes`  | `dict`                | Type-specific structured fields. |
| `sources`     | `list[Provenance]`    | One per discovery. Never empty. |
| `confidence`  | `float`               | 0.0–1.0. Recomputed on merge. |
| `first_seen`  | `datetime`            | Earliest collection time. |
| `last_seen`   | `datetime`            | Latest collection time. |
| `tags`        | `set[str]`            | Free-form labels (e.g. `wildcard`, `expired`). |

### Entity types (cyber-first)

- **Domain** — `attributes`: `registered_domain`, `tld`, `is_wildcard`.
- **IPAddress** — `attributes`: `version` (4/6), `is_private`.
- **Certificate** — `attributes`: `sha256`, `serial`, `issuer`, `subject`, `not_before`, `not_after`, `sans` (list).
- **Service** — a host:port observation. `attributes`: `ip`, `port`, `protocol`, `product`, `banner`. (Populated by scan-data sources like Shodan in Phase 3.)
- **ASN** — `attributes`: `number`, `name`, `org`.
- **Netblock** — `attributes`: `cidr`, `asn`.
- **Email** — `attributes`: `local`, `domain`.
- **Username** — `attributes`: `platform` (nullable).
- **URL** — `attributes`: `scheme`, `host`, `path`.
- **Person** — secondary; `attributes`: `name`, `aliases`.
- **Organization** — secondary; `attributes`: `name`, `legal_id`.

> Adding an entity type = extend the `EntityType` enum and document its `attributes` here. No other layer should hardcode type knowledge except entity-ID derivation (§6).

Phase 4 begins producing `IPAddress` entities from passive DNS resolution; the schema type pre-existed and did not change.

---

## 5. Relationship model

Relationships are typed, directed edges. They carry their **own** provenance and confidence (the same envelope minus `value`/`attributes`).

| Relation        | From → To                | Meaning |
|-----------------|--------------------------|---------|
| `HAS_SUBDOMAIN` | Domain → Domain          | Registered domain to discovered subdomain. |
| `RESOLVES_TO`   | Domain → IPAddress       | DNS resolution observation. |
| `SECURES`       | Certificate → Domain     | Cert SAN/CN covers this domain. |
| `ANNOUNCES`     | ASN → Netblock           | ASN announces this prefix. |
| `CONTAINS`      | Netblock → IPAddress     | IP falls within prefix. |
| `HOSTS`         | IPAddress → Service      | Observed service on host. |
| `ASSOCIATED_WITH` | Email/Username → Person | Identity linkage (lower default confidence). |

Edge envelope: `{ id, type, src_id, dst_id, sources, confidence, first_seen, last_seen }`. Edge `id` is deterministic from `(type, src_id, dst_id)`.

Phase 4 begins producing `RESOLVES_TO` relationships from passive DNS resolution; the relationship type pre-existed and did not change.

---

## 6. Identity & deduplication

- **Deterministic IDs.** `id = sha1(f"{type}:{canonical_value}")[:16]`. Canonicalization rules per type live in `core/ids.py` (lowercase + strip trailing dot for domains; `ipaddress` module normalization for IPs; `sha256` for certs).
- **Merge on collision.** When a connector yields an entity whose ID already exists, the store **merges**: unions `sources`, unions `tags`, extends `first_seen`/`last_seen`, deep-merges `attributes` (new non-null fields win only if previously absent; conflicts are recorded under `attributes["_conflicts"]`).
- **Confidence on merge.** Base confidence is per-connector (declared on the connector). On merge, confidence rises with independent corroboration:
  `confidence = 1 - Π(1 - c_i)` over distinct **source names** (not distinct findings). Capped at 0.99. This is the noisy-OR rule: two independent 0.7 sources → 0.91.

---

## 7. The passive / active boundary

The single most important professional control in the system.

- Every connector declares `mode: CollectionMode` ∈ {`PASSIVE`, `ACTIVE`}.
  - **PASSIVE** = querying third-party databases that already hold the data (certificate transparency, passive DNS, Shodan's existing scans, breach indexes). No packets to the target.
  - **ACTIVE** = touching the target's own infrastructure (port scans, vuln scans, directory brute-forcing, direct probing).
- A run carries an `Authorization` object describing the in-scope targets the operator is authorized to actively engage.
- **The orchestrator refuses to dispatch an ACTIVE connector against a seed unless that seed's target is covered by the run's `Authorization`.** Refusals are logged. Unauthorized active collection is illegal in many jurisdictions regardless of intent — this gate exists so the engine cannot do it by accident.
- Phase 1 ships **zero** active connectors. The gate is built and tested anyway (with a dummy active connector in tests) so the boundary exists before any active capability does.

---

## 8. Connector contract

```python
class CollectionMode(StrEnum):
    PASSIVE = "passive"
    ACTIVE = "active"

class Connector(ABC):
    name: str                      # unique, e.g. "crtsh"
    source: str                    # human source label, e.g. "crt.sh"
    description: str
    mode: CollectionMode
    accepts: set[EntityType]       # seed types it can act on
    produces: set[EntityType]      # entity types it may yield
    requires_api_key: bool = False
    base_confidence: float = 0.6   # per-source prior

    @abstractmethod
    async def collect(
        self, seed: Entity, ctx: CollectionContext
    ) -> AsyncIterator[Finding]:
        """Yield Findings derived from `seed`. Must not mutate `seed`.
        Must route all network I/O through `ctx` (rate-limited, cached)."""
```

- **`CollectionContext`** provides everything a connector may touch: a rate-limited `httpx.AsyncClient`, the cache, config/secrets, a structured logger, and the run `Authorization`. Connectors get nothing else — no direct store access, no global state.
- **`Finding`** = `{ entities: list[Entity], relationships: list[Relationship] }` produced from one logical observation, each element already populated with a `Provenance` record stamped with the connector's `name`, `source`, query, timestamp, and a `raw_ref` (pointer to the stored raw artifact).
- Connectors construct `Domain` entities via the shared `build_domain_entity` helper so the §4 domain rules cannot drift between connectors.
- Connectors are **registered** via decorator/entry-point into a `REGISTRY` keyed by `name`; the orchestrator selects applicable connectors by matching `seed.type ∈ connector.accepts`.

### Neo4j graph model (Phase 3)

Entities persist as nodes with labels `:Entity` and the entity type label, such as `:Domain` or `:Certificate`, under a uniqueness constraint on `Entity.id`. Native properties store `id`, `value`, `confidence`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, and `tags`; nested fields are losslessly serialized as `attributes_json`, `sources_json`, and `source_confidences_json`.

Relationships persist as typed Neo4j relationships (`:SECURES`, `:HAS_SUBDOMAIN`, etc.) with `id`, `confidence`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `sources_json`, and `source_confidences_json`. Relationship types are selected only from the `RelationType` enum. The Neo4j store uses read-modify-write and the shared store merge functions; Cypher only reads and writes merged properties. Modeling provenance as separate `:Source` nodes is deferred until a later phase.

Phase 3 adds a minimal `Engine.run(..., store=None)` injection hook because the Phase 1 engine always constructed `MemoryEntityStore` internally. The hook preserves the existing default while allowing Neo4j to receive individual findings during collection, which is required to persist the exact per-source confidence map.

### Multi-hop pivoting (Phase 4)

Multi-hop pivoting is opt-in: `max_depth=0` processes only the initial seed, preserving the Phase 1-3 single-hop behavior. Runs also carry conservative default budgets (`max_seeds=10`, `max_calls=30`); a budget stop is recorded in the audit log.

Recording and pivoting are separate controls. Every discovered entity and relationship is stored with provenance, but a discovered entity becomes a later seed only if the current depth is below `max_depth`, the entity has not already been visited, at least one registered connector accepts its type, and the pivot policy allows it. Domains pivot only when `attributes["under_seed"] is True`; `co-san` and external domains are terminal. IP addresses pivot only when the run authorization covers them. Other entity types are terminal in Phase 4.

The passive/active gate is enforced per hop before dispatch. Unauthorized active connectors are refused and recorded in the audit log; Phase 4 still ships no active connectors.

## 10. Phased roadmap

1. **Core engine + plugin interface + crt.sh.** Orchestration loop, entity/relationship schema, deterministic IDs, in-memory/JSON store, passive/active gate, one passive connector (crt.sh). Proven end-to-end on a domain. *(see `PHASE1_BRIEF.md`)*
2. **Second passive connector + cross-source confidence.** Add Wayback Machine CDX as an independent passive source and prove noisy-OR confidence across overlapping `Domain` entities.
3. **Entity resolution + Neo4j.** Swap store to Neo4j behind the same interface; richer merge/link analysis.
4. **Multi-hop pivoting + DNS resolution.** Frontier-based pivoting with depth/budget controls and passive DNS resolution from Domain to IPAddress.
5. **Breadth.** Shodan, Censys, passive DNS, Amass/Subfinder wrappers, HaveIBeenPwned, GitHub dorking; caching + first (gated) active connector.
6. **Reporting + visualization.** Investigation report with per-finding sources & confidence; link-graph view.
7. **Agent layer.** LLM planner that pivots across connectors and writes the narrative report. Engine remains the source of truth.

## 12. Coding-agent rules

- Work against this spec. Do not invent schema or connector behavior not described here; if a gap exists, propose an edit to this file.
- One driver per file at a time. Do not let two agents refactor the same module in parallel.
- No connector may bypass `CollectionContext` for I/O.
- No feature may emit an entity/relationship without provenance.
- Tests must not hit the live network.
